# Sounds for Sleep App

This is a minimal site for playing sounds to fall asleep to. It has three audio players (Rain, White-Noise, & Fire). The sounds can be mixed and matched and volumes independently adjusted.

### What I learned

I use similar apps/sites often and wanted to create this one for some practice with web API's. Event delegation was very useful for all the event listeners to minimize repetitive code.
